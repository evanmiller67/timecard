This is a simple webapp that will barf up a spreadsheet based on a simple format.
Right now this format looks like:
  | [name]      | [supervisor]  | [date]  |
  | project[0]  | allocation[0] |         |
  | project[1]  | allocation[1] |         |
  | project[2]  | allocation[2] |         |
  | project[3]  | allocation[3] |         |
  | project[4]  | allocation[4] |         |
  | ...         | ...           |         |
  

It's my way of getting around having to open Excel for time reporting. 

I know it's not well written, not at all idiomatic, but it was written in a few hours to solve a specific purpose.  

Feel free to do with it as you will and I full license it under the WTF Public License (http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING). I mean... it's on Github and a public repo, so what's stopping you from just going crazy?
